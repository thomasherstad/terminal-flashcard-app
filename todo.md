## Focus
- Search function is failing
- Noun.py list tests are failing

## Title/Menus screen logic
- Add searching for another word after search and cancel
- Need to add a cancel to add noun

## Play function
- Standard play mode (all due nouns)
    - Game screen:
        - Show front side
        - Give options for article
        - Show rear side
        - Give options for again, hard, good, easy
    - Need to re-sort on the datetime object at some point during the game
- Play due + X amount of learning

## Database csv 
- Write tests for read and write

## NounList class
- Have populate_from_list function use a loop to make it work when changing csv format
- Create tests
- Function to remove duplicates

## Noun class
- Fix tests

## Bugs
- Need to clean the screen before main menu. But then maybe add a sleep
- Crash when you choose done before editing a word

## For a Finished App
- Being able to play 15 nouns, custom amount or all cards
- Check how many cards are due


## For Later
- Implement ability to have multiple decks
- Create a scraper that automatically fills in noun info
- Graphic for terminal view, nice card, menu
- Have tests for every used function
